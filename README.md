# multivariate-linear-regression-from-scratch
An implementation of multivariate linear regression from scratch to predict the weights of fish.

## Data
The dataset holds information about 159 different fish, specifying their:
- weight (grams)
- vertical length (cm). Expressed as 'Length1' in data.
- diagonal length (cm). Expressed as 'Length2' in data.
- cross length (cm). Expressed as 'Length3' in data.
- height (cm)
- width (cm)

The model should be able to provide an estimate of the weight of a fish given information about its vertical length, diagonal length, cross length, height and width. To do this, a linear regression model is constructed.
